1 git:
2 config:
  1 profiles
      - for local running and for docker deployment, db has issues
      - application.yaml has commented out links to db's - fix needed via profiles most likely
  - db:
    - flyway/ liquibase for setting up db & entities
    - docker-compose
    - integration tests
    - application variables for db connection (?)
  - slf4j for logging
3 semantics:
  - user entity:
      - password hashing prior to persistence
  - user roles
  - mapstruct mappers
4 logic:
  - /register
  - /login
  - /CRUD
  - spring validation via spring-boot-starter-validation
  - exception handler
  - unit & integration tests

wishlist:
  - kafka queue to notification-service with creation/update/deletion
  - aspects:
      - on user creation
      - on user update
      - on user deletion
