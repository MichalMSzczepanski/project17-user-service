5 issues:
  - build takes 40 seconds due to mongo and kafka embedding in tests
4 logic:
  - spring validation via spring-boot-starter-validation (tbc)
  - job for expired activation keys (24h from creation date)
3 semantics:
  - test kafka producer
  - test secret key persistence of same userId and keyType
  - validate phone number via regex
  - test one secret key type is assigned to user at one time
  - validation error handling in globalexceptionhandler
  - mock sending message via kafka to notification-service with email for verification
  - split InvalidActivationKeyException into not found with 404 and an actual error
  - update DTO for creation (does not take in "active")
  - externalize and encapsulate credentials/ hashing salt
  - controller tests
2 config:
  - db:
      - application variables for db connection (?)
1 git:

wishlist:
  - aspects for checking authorization in headers
  - kafka queue to notification-service with creation/update/deletion
  - kafka queue to present-service to manage presents
  - aspects:
      - on user creation
      - on user update
      - on user deletion
