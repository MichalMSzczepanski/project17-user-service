4 logic:
  - /register
  - /login
  - email after registration for confirmation
  - spring validation via spring-boot-starter-validation (tbc)
  - job for expired activation keys (24h from creation date)
3 semantics:
  - patch/activate should return more than 200
  - mock sending message via kafka to notification-service with email for verification
  - split InvalidActivationKeyException into not found with 404 and an actual error
  - update DTO for creation (does not take in "active")
  - externalize and encapsulate credentials/ hashing salt
2 config:
  - db:
      - application variables for db connection (?)
1 git:

wishlist:
  - kafka queue to notification-service with creation/update/deletion
  - kafka queue to present-service to manage presents
  - aspects:
      - on user creation
      - on user update
      - on user deletion
